This event describes "Dissociation" of molecules, such as [GGPs](), [Organic_compound_other](), [Pharmacological_substance]() and [Inorganic_compound](), which had interacted with each other, as described in [Binding](). Thus, this event is opposite to [Binding]().

UMLS ID for this event; Molecular dissociation (UMLS; C0301643).

Moreover, dissociation between molecules and [Cell]()/[Cell_component]() will be categorized in [Localization]().

Dissociation between [Cell]()/[Cell_component]() will be categorized in [Cellular_process]().

The following words/phrases can be triggers of this event:

- *disaggregate*, *disaggregates*, *disaggregated*, *disaggregation*
- *disassemble*, *disassembles*, *disassembled*, *disassembly*
- *disrupt*, *disrupts*, *disrupted*, *disruption*
- *dissociate*, *dissociates*, *dissociated*, *dissociation*
- *free*, *frees*; *freed*
- *release*, *releases*, *released*, *releasing*



Arguments:

The *Theme* (optional; multiple) indicates molecular entities, such as [GGPs](), [Organic_compound_other](), [Pharmacological_substance](), and [Inorganic_compound]().

No *Cause* is annotated for this event.

The *atLoc* (optional) indicates the location where the `Dissociation` event occurs: [Cell_component](), [Cell]() or [Anatomical_entity]().

The *disorder* (optional) indicates the [Disorder]() for which the `Dissociation` event occurs.

The *Cue* argument (optional) is cues, such as [Negation cue](), [Speculation cue]() or [Method cue]().
