This event describes 'Artificial processes', which are usually specific actions for experimental procedures/medical treatments. Thus, this event can affect entities and the other events.

Analysis/assay names should be annotated as [Method cue](), which may suggest confirmation/speculation degree of events.

The following words/phrases can be triggers for this event:
- treat/treatment
  - pretreatment (UMLS; C3539076)
- incubate/incubation (UMLS; C1439852)
  - preincubation
- addition
- culture/cultured (UMLS; C1449619)
  - coculture (UMLS; C0282547)
- transfection (UMLS; C0040669)
- exposure (UMLS; C0332157)
- administer/administration (UMLS; C1621583)
- adoptive transfer (UMLS; C0376518)
- concentrate (UMLS; C2003864)
- decellularize(d)/decellularization (UMLS; C3827823)
- surgery (UMLS; C0543467)
